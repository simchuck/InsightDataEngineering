# Geographic Resource Dispatch

## 1. Title Slide

Geographic Resource Dispatch

Optimizing the utilization of geographically distributed computing resources for processing data based on real-time resource characteristics.

## 2. The Problem



## 3. The Solution



## 4. How I Did It



### simulations and APIs
    - start with static data set, with simulated streaming engine
    - simulate range of network variability (latency, throughput, availability)
    - simulate accelerated data stream rate
    - simulate arbitrarily large resource network
    - implement for real-time data (as available)
    - randomized job queue parameters
    - randomized job processing performance
### analytical models
    - energy modeling for resource cooling systems
    - 
### optimization algorithm
### monitoring & visualization

## 5. Technology

AWS
    S3
    Lambda (?)
    EC2
    (database)

Kafka
KSQL
Python
Dash (or Flask)
Prometheus / Grafana

## 6. What's Next

* scale across arbitrary resources
* evaluate ability to handle network issues
* evaluate ability to handle fast streams
* incorporate real-world dispatch of DE job (meta)
* add predictive capabilities
    - based on existing forecasts
    - based on new forecasting models
