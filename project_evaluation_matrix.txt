I want to create a "matrix" that I can use to systematically evaluate project ideas to down-select the best option for demonstrating my work while at Insight.



Desirable Characteristics
- demonstrate features and technologies across the breadth of the Data Engineering ecosystem
- demonstrate functionality depth
- batch vs. streaming
- monitoring/dashboard
- reprocessing
- latency, throughput, etc
- robustness
- scalability
- real-world application
- basis for other similar projects
- general interest
- thought provoking; inspire questions / ideas from audience
- can achieve reasonable scope in available time
- can envision clear roadmap for future development / expansion



For each project:
- log line - a brief statement describing the project and why it is interesting
- a list of technology stack elements
- pros and cons
- outline / pseudocode for implementation
- roadmap for development
- useful graphics
- reference projects, etc
