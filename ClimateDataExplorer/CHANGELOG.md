## Project: Climate Data Explorer

2019.03.20  15:30
Initial commit of project README was broadly concerned with collecting multiple 
climate-related datasets, each with distinct schema and timing, and grouping in
a manner to facilitate simple visualization by data scientist users to allow
them to develop some intuition prior to down-selecting for further analysis.

Based on feedback from project check-in, Curtis suggested an approach which 
puts more focus on collecting real-time data for weather, energy pricing, and
energy requirements, and incorporates a geographic/regional element to provide
the challenge of latency and data consistency.
