# Insight Data Engineering Projects

This repository includes project ideas under development during the Insight Data Engineering 19A-SEA cohort.  

## Idea #1:  Climate Data Explorer

Climate change is a critical and topical issue, and there are many diverse sources of data that characterize its causes and effects via both quantitative and qualitative means.  The goal of this project is to bring this data together into a common tool that can provide various reporting and visualization tools to help the data engineer develop intuition about the datasets, and to identify potential correlations that could be further explored.
