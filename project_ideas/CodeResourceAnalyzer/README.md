This repository includes project ideas under development during the Insight Data Engineering 19A-SEA cohort.  

## Idea #2:  Code Resource Analyzer
 
Most modern businesses rely on extensive use of computing resources, including your desktop/laptop, network, and cloud data storage.  As technology has advanced, computing power and storage has become a relatively cheap commodity, and the need to limit resource usage is driven by performance rather than concerns regarding the required resources and associated energy consumption.  This energy consumption can be related to real operating costs, as well as to their indirect impact on the world climate.  The goal of this project is to analyze existing code repositories to characterize the occurence different coding paradigms/idioms, and to relate these alternatives to their associated CPU, network, and cloud storage resource requirements.  From these correlations, best practices can be developed for optimizing the resource requirements.  These best practices can then be codified into a streaming service for static code analysis as new code is committed or pushed to repositories.
